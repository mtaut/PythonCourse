## Exercise 1.2 Data Types in Python

Step 1: For this task and for the data structure, I've decided to use a dictionary for the recipes. I chose this because it utilizes key-value pairs, which are perfect for the requirements of the task: recipe name-string, cooking_time-integer, and ingredients-list. Dictionaries are also flexible in accessing values and creating new dictionaries with different data types.

Step 3: For the structure of all_recipes, I am using a list of dictionaries. I'm using this because with the values() method I can return each recipe in a list that's all nested within my all_recipes dictionary.
